## Profitable App for the Google Play Markets


#### The goal of this analysis is to find mobile app that is profitable for the Google play market.

 I assumed as a data analyst working for some company that builds android apps is help the developers to make data-driven decisions.

```The apps are Free.``` 

```The main source of revenue is in-app ads.```

> So it means the revenue for any app is influenced by the number of users that use the app.

I took the dataset from **Kaggle**
